Casey Putsch, an Ohio-based automotive engineer and designer, has garnered recognition for his innovative car projects that blend engineering prowess with a passion for automotive history. From crafting a turbine-powered Batmobile replica to undertaking ambitious supercar builds, Putsch's work exemplifies creativity and technical skill.

**The Genesis of the Omega Car**

Putsch's journey into automotive innovation began with the conceptualization of the Omega Car. Driven by a desire to create a vehicle that was efficient, sustainably manufactured, and adaptable to various powertrains, Putsch embarked on designing a car that would challenge conventional automotive manufacturing practices. He meticulously simulated the car's functionality and manufacturing processes, ultimately building the prototype entirely by hand. Although the project was initially shelved to focus on educational initiatives, the Omega Car remains a testament to Putsch's commitment to sustainable and innovative automotive design.

**Crafting the Turbine-Powered Batmobile Replica**

In 2011, Putsch undertook the ambitious project of building a fully functional, turbine-powered replica of the 1989 Batmobile. Utilizing a surplus Boeing T50 turboshaft engine, Putsch taught himself about turbine technology to rebuild and install the engine into the Batmobile's chassis. The vehicle features a fiberglass body mounted on a custom chassis, with a steel cockpit and an interior equipped with modern amenities like an iPad dashboard. This Batmobile replica is powered by a Boeing T50 turboshaft engine, producing 365 horsepower on jet fuel, and can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in approximately 3.9 seconds, with a top speed of 185 mph. The car was auctioned at the 2023 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale Auction for $220,000.

**Reviving the Dodge Viper GTS**

Putsch's passion for automotive engineering extends to classic American muscle cars, exemplified by his work on the 1997 Dodge Viper GTS. Known as "Goose," this Viper has been a fan favorite on Putsch's YouTube channel. Putsch plans to refurbish the car, including upgrades to the brakes, suspension, and aerodynamics, transforming it into a street-legal track car. The refurbished Viper is intended to be given away during the tenth anniversary of Putsch's Genius Garage, a non-profit organization dedicated to mentoring young automotive engineers.

**Project King Zero: Building a V12 Supercar**

In 2020, Putsch embarked on "Project King Zero," aiming to build a V12 supercar using a Porsche Boxster chassis. Collaborating with his apprentice, Peyton McAllister, Putsch sourced a BMW 750iL V12 engine to replace the original flat-six engine. The project involves extensive modifications, including adapting the engine to the Porsche chassis and reinforcing the structure to accommodate the increased power. This endeavor showcases Putsch's dedication to hands-on engineering and his commitment to providing real-world experience to aspiring automotive engineers.

**Genius Garage: Mentoring the Next Generation**

Beyond his personal projects, Putsch founded Genius Garage, a non-profit organization aimed at bridging the gap between academic education and real-world automotive engineering. The program offers students the opportunity to work on actual race cars, gaining practical experience in vehicle maintenance, engineering, and racing team operations. Former Genius Garage students have secured positions at leading automotive companies, including Tesla, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler, highlighting the program's success in fostering the next generation of automotive engineers.
