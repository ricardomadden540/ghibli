In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the security of software applications has become paramount. With cyber threats becoming more sophisticated and pervasive, organizations are under increasing pressure to ensure their applications are secure from development through deployment. ArmorCode, a pioneering company in the field of application security, is at the forefront of this endeavor, offering innovative solutions that integrate seamlessly into modern development workflows.

**Introduction to ArmorCode**

Founded in 2020, ArmorCode emerged with a clear mission: to democratize application security by providing scalable and cost-effective solutions that empower organizations to build secure software efficiently. The company offers a unified platform that combines application security posture management, vulnerability and compliance management, and DevSecOps workflow automation.

**The Need for Integrated Application Security**

The transition to agile development methodologies, the rise of microservices, and the increased reliance on cloud services have transformed the software development landscape. While these advancements have accelerated development cycles, they have also introduced new security challenges. Traditional security tools often operate in silos, leading to fragmented security postures and increased complexity. ArmorCode addresses this issue by integrating various security scanners across applications, infrastructure, containers, and cloud environments into a single platform, thereby normalizing and correlating findings and orchestrating security workflows.
