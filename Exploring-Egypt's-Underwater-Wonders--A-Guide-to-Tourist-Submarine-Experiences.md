Egypt's Red Sea coast offers some of the world's most captivating underwater landscapes, making it a prime destination for marine enthusiasts. For those seeking a unique perspective of this aquatic paradise, tourist submarines provide an unparalleled opportunity to explore the depths without getting wet.

**Understanding Tourist Submarines in Egypt**

Tourist submarines are specialized vessels designed to submerge beneath the water's surface, allowing passengers to observe marine life and coral reefs up close. Unlike semi-submersibles, which remain partially above water, these submarines dive to significant depths, offering a true underwater experience.

**Sindbad Submarines: A Premier Experience**

One of the most renowned operators in Egypt is Sindbad Submarines, based in Hurghada. They offer a unique adventure aboard real submarines, providing a 40-minute journey 25 meters below the sea. Passengers can witness the vibrant coral reefs and diverse marine life through panoramic windows. The submarines are equipped with 44 passenger seats and two pilot seats, ensuring a comfortable and safe experience. ([sindbadsubmarines.com](https://www.sindbadsubmarines.com/?utm_source=openai))

**Safety Measures and Recent Incidents**

Safety is paramount in the tourist submarine industry. Sindbad Submarines, for instance, emphasizes adherence to international safety standards. However, on March 27, 2025, a tragic incident occurred when one of their submarines sank off the coast of Hurghada, resulting in the loss of six Russian tourists and injuries to several others. The cause of the sinking is under investigation, highlighting the importance of stringent safety protocols.

**Alternative Submarine Experiences**

Beyond Hurghada, other regions in Egypt offer submarine tours. For example, Marsa Alam provides semi-submarine tours that allow passengers to view marine life through large windows without fully submerging. These tours often include additional activities, such as seafood lunches, enhancing the overall experience.

Prices for submarine tours vary based on location, duration, and inclusions. In Hurghada, a typical Sindbad Submarine tour lasts about three hours, including hotel transfers, and is priced at approximately $54 per adult. Children aged 4 to 10 are often eligible for discounted rates.
