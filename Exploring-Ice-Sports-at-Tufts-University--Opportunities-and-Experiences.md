**Tufts University Club Hockey: A Coed Competitive Team**

The Tufts Club Hockey team is a coed organization that competes against other club hockey programs in the Boston area. Operating from October through March, the team practices three times a week, typically in the late evening at a nearby rink, with transportation provided for members. Competing in Division III of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA), the team plays games almost every weekend. While league regulations require a set roster for these games, the team strives to include all interested players in at least one game, ensuring a welcoming environment for all skill levels. In the 2023–24 season, the team made history by playing its first women's-only game, becoming associate members of the Independent Women's Club Hockey League (IWCHL). This initiative aims to provide more opportunities for female-identifying players and foster inclusivity within the sport.
