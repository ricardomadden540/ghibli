**Inspiration Behind 'Hampstead'**

The song draws its name from the Hampstead neighborhood in London, where Grande resided during the filming of the movie *Wicked* between 2022 and 2024. In interviews, she described her time in Hampstead as "fun" and "delightful," highlighting her love for walks on Hampstead Heath and visits to local shops and pubs.

The chorus, "What's wrong with a little bit of poison? Tell me," reflects a willingness to embrace life's challenges rather than avoiding them.
