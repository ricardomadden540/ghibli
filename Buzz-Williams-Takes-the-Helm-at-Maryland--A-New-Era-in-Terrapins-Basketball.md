**A Storied Coaching Career**

Buzz Williams' coaching journey began in the mid-1990s, quickly ascending through various assistant coaching roles. His first head coaching position was at the University of New Orleans during the 2006–07 season, where he laid the foundation for his future successes.

In 2014, Williams took the helm at Virginia Tech, where he continued to build on his reputation for revitalizing programs. His tenure was marked by consistent improvement, culminating in a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2019. Following his success at Virginia Tech, Williams moved to Texas A&M in 2019, leading the Aggies to three consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and earning SEC Coach of the Year honors in both 2020 and 2023.

**Transition to Maryland**

Williams' appointment at Maryland follows the departure of former head coach Kevin Willard, who left to assume the head coaching position at Villanova. Willard had guided Maryland to a 27–9 record in the 2024–25 season, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance in the NCAA Tournament. Despite this success, Willard expressed concerns about the program's direction, leading to his decision to move on.
